#Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Keystone, an open source project administered by
ThinkMill.

Contributing to Keystone is easy. In a few simple steps:

* Ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to
the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it.
* Make something better or fix a bug.
* Make sure you do not add regressions by running `npm test`. There should not
be more errors than you began with.
* Make sure you do not add jshint violations. Run `make lint`. There should not
be more violations than you began with.
* Adhere to code style outlined in the .jscsrc file. Run `make style`. Ensure
you did not add more style violations than you began with.
* Submit a pull request through Github.
