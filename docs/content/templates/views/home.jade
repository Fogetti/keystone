		h2.text-center Get a head-start on the features you need
		p.lead Keystone is the easiest way to build a web application or content-managed website in node.js. It only takes a few lines of code to get up and running with:
		.row
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Express.js and Mongo
				p Keystone will configure express - the de facto web server for node.js - for you and connect to your mongo database using mongoose, the leading ODM package.
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Static Assets and Dynamic Routes
				p Keystone starts with best practices for setting up your MV* application, and makes it easy to manage your templates, views and routes.
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Sophisticated Database Fields
				p IDs, Strings, Booleans, Dates and Numbers are the building blocks of your database. Keystone builds on these with useful, real-world field types like 
					| name, email, password, address, image and relationship fields (and more)
		.row
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Auto-generated Admin UI
				p Whether you use it while you're building out your application, or in production as a database content management system, Keystone's Admin UI will 
					| save you time and make managing your data easy.
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Simpler Code
				p Sometimes, async code can get complicated to do simple things. Keystone helps keep simple things - like loading data before displaying it in a view - simple.
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Form Processing
				p Want to validate a form, upload an image, and update your database with a single line? Keystone can do that, based on the data models you've already defined.
		.row
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Session Management
				p Keystone comes ready out of the box with session management and authentication features, including automatic encryption for password fields.
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Email Sending
				p Keystone makes it easy to set up, preview and send template-based emails for your application. It also integrates with Mandrill (Mailchimp's excellent 
					| transaction email sending service)
			.col-sm-4
				h4 Managed Updates
				p Keystone includes an optional updates framework, that can take care of running update scripts for you, making it easy to transition from development 
					| to production.
	
	
	section.intro-section.admin-section: .container
		h2.text-center A beautiful, customisable Admin UI based on your models
		.text-center: img(src='/images/admin-interface.jpg').img-responsive
	
	
	section.intro-section.tools-section: .container
		h2.text-center What you build is up to you.
		p.lead There are a lot of frameworks that make decisions for you, and many that take decisions away. Keystone doesn't do that. Use the features that suit you,
			| and replace the ones that don't.
		.row
			.col-sm-3
				h4 Built on Express
				p Keystone can configure Express for you, or you can take over and treat Keystone like any other Express middleware.
				p You can also easily integrate it into an existing Express app.
			.col-sm-3
				h4 Built with Mongoose
				p Mongoose, supported by MongoDB Inc, is the leading ODM for node.js and MongoDB. Keystone exposes mongoose to you when you need it, so anything you 
					| can build with MongoDB, you can build with Keystone.
			.col-sm-3
				h4 Lightweight
				p Keystone is designed to be as light as you want - you can pick and choose the features you want to include.
				p Write your own routes, disable the Admin UI, whatever - it's up to you.
			.col-sm-3
				h4 Extendable
				p One of the greatest things about node.js is the vast number of quality packages available.
				p Keystone is designed to let you use any of them, without losing the benefits it provides.

		h3 Vision
		p Keystone has been built based on patterns and tools that have evolved in the real world,
			| and the core team has used it in several production applications.
		p We have released Keystone under the MIT License to help other developers, and so the project can grow beyond what we're using it for.
		p Feedback and contributions are very welcome. We are currently working on documentation and examples, and have a lot of exciting features to add.
